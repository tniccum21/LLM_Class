      "  \"email_body\": \"Dear Customer Support,\\n\\nI’m writing to report a recurring issue with our Cisco ISR4331 router that’s been causing frequent network outages. This problem has persisted over the past few weeks and is critically impacting our day‑to‑day operations. Our company relies heavily on a stable, secure network connection, and these current disruptions are affecting both productivity and service quality.\\n\\nThe affected router—model ISR4331—is a critical component of our network infrastructure and therefore requires immediate attention. We’ve attempted internal troubleshooting but couldn’t pinpoint the root cause of the performance issue. Possible causes we suspect include a hardware fault or a software configuration error, though we don’t rule out other potential problems that may need your expert assessment.\\n\\nOur service agreement with your company has always been reliable, and we hope to continue relying on such dependable support. Given the severity and urgency of this matter, we request an expedited review and timely resolution. Attached you’ll find the network logs and a brief summary of the troubleshooting steps already taken. We’re ready to collaborate closely during this phase and provide any additional information you may need.\\n\\nWe look forward to your prompt response. You can reach me directly at <tel_num> if you have immediate questions.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n<name>\\nNetwork Administrator\\n<company_name>\\n<email_address>\",\n",
